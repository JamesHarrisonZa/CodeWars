We all love fridays, and even better if it is the last day of the month!

In this kata you should write a function that will receive 2 parameters. Both are years, and indicates a range.

Your work is to return the number of times a month ends with a Friday.

If there is only one year provided, return the number of times a month ends on Friday on that year. Range bounds are inclusive in every case!

For example, between 1901 and 2000, a month ends on Friday 101 times.
